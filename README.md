# A Blog Starter App

This is my **Lifeguard Blog Starter App**

This project is a Firebase-based blog application built with React, Firestore, and Firebase Authentication, allowing users to sign in, create, and manage blog posts. The app is fully responsive, designed with CSS Grid and Flexbox, and includes a soft gradient background for a modern look. Users can create, read, update, and delete posts, with real-time updates via Firestore. Firebase Authentication manages user sign-in, and the app is hosted on Firebase Hosting.
